PyTrieLib
=========

Messing with trie data structures in python. This is meant to be an exercise in their use and
a library others can use.


CSV files can be read by the PyTrie class and used to populate a trie with the words in the csv. Currently the csv
reader assumes that the words are stored in the first column of the file.
